# Solution Exercise 1-6

The standard that officially defines the C++ programming language are copyrighted and distributed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The final version of the standards are not free but there are draft versions that can be retrieved for free. The drafts might not be identical to the released version but for practical purposes for anyone just wanting to learn C++ the drafts will be enough.

ISO have a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cplusplus) with LaTex source code that can be used to generate the draft standards, and there also some pdf versions published in the release section.

The ISO GitHub repository can be a bit overwhelming. If just wanting to access a pdf version of a draft standard so are these more accessible at the C++ section of the site [open-std.org](https://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/standards#14882).
