# Solution Exercise 1-3

There are various debuggers available to be able the troubleshoot and verify functionality of C++ programs:

- Visual Studio, comes in several versions community edition is free
- Visual Studio Code Editor with C++ extensions
- GCC with GDB on the command line

I personally tested to debug the program from exercise 1-2 using the Visual Studio Code editor that I have setup with some extensions for C++ development. Honestly not sure which extension it is that kicks in when I debug but I was able to set break points in the code and step through the execution of the program. Could see current variable values and also the values of individual CPU registers.
