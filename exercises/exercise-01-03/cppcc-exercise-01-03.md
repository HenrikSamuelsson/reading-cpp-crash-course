# Solution Exercise 1-3

There are various debuggers available to be able the troubleshoot and verify functionality of C++ programs.

I tested to debug the program from exercise 1-2 using Visual Studio Code that I have setup with some extensions for C++ development. Honestly not sure which extension it is that kicks in when I debug but I was able to set break points in the code and step through the execution of the program. Could also see variable values and even the values of individual CPU registers.
